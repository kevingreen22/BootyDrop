 ~ Game ending sequence needs refining, by maybe "pulsing" red start-line, or adding a countdown clock?  (maybe add a way to test it in previews)

 ~ fix drop-nodes sometimes sticking together when a merge happens. (bug)
 
 ~ fix the drop-nodes from sticking half way over the edges when just tapping instead of dragging.
 
 ~ Add the physics bodies for the drop objects in the GameScene file as pre "built" objects so its saves on runtime memory.
